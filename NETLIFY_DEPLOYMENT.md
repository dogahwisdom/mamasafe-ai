# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Development & Production Workflow

Deploy to Netlify and continue working on features. Netlify will:
- Deploy your current code
- Create preview deployments for every branch/PR
- Keep production separate until ready
- Auto-deploy on every push

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Option 1: Branch-Based (Recommended)
- Main branch → Production (when ready)
- Development branch → Preview deployments
- Feature branches → Automatic previews

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
- Deploy manually when ready
- Continue local development
- Push to production when features are complete

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code

1. Make sure everything is committed:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"
   ```

2. Push to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Method A: Connect via GitHub (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Sign up/Login (free account works!)
3. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
4. Choose "GitHub" (or GitLab/Bitbucket)
5. Authorize Netlify to access your repo
6. Select your mamasafe-ai repository
7. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Base directory: (leave empty)
8. Click "Deploy site"

#### Method B: Manual Deploy (Quick Test)

1. Build your app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
3. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
4. Your site is live! (temporary URL)

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to: Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://mxjwsdizjpdwfleebucu.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   TRIAGE_ENGINE_API_KEY=your_triage_key_here
   ```
3. Click "Save"
4. Redeploy your site (Deploys → Trigger deploy)

---

## Development Workflow

### Continue Working Locally:

1. Make changes in your code
2. Test locally: `npm run dev`
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Netlify auto-deploys (takes 2-3 minutes)
5. Preview URL is generated automatically

### Work on Features:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/whatsapp-integration

# Make changes
# ... your code ...

# Commit and push
git push origin feature/whatsapp-integration

# Netlify creates preview deployment automatically!
# You get a unique URL like: https://feature-whatsapp--mamasafe.netlify.app
```

---

## Production vs Preview

### Preview Deployments (Automatic)
- Every branch/PR gets a preview URL
- Perfect for testing features
- Share with team/stakeholders
- Doesn't affect production

### Production Deployment
- Only deploys from `main` branch (or branch you choose)
- Set in: Site settings → Build & deploy → Production branch
- Update when you're ready to go live

---

## Netlify Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file includes:
- Build settings
- SPA routing (redirects)
- Security headers
- Cache optimization

No additional setup needed.

---

## Environment Variables Setup

### In Netlify Dashboard:

1. Go to: Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add these (get from your `.env.local`):

   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://mxjwsdizjpdwfleebucu.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   TRIAGE_ENGINE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. Important: 
   - Use VITE_ prefix for client-side variables
   - Never commit `.env.local` to git
   - Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`

---

## Quick Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] `netlify.toml` created (done)
- [ ] `.netlifyignore` created (done)
- [ ] Connect repo to Netlify
- [ ] Set build command: `npm run build`
- [ ] Set publish directory: `dist`
- [ ] Add environment variables
- [ ] Deploy!

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Preview URLs
- Every branch gets a unique preview URL
- Share with team for testing
- Perfect for client demos

### 2. Branch Deploys
- Work on features in separate branches
- Each branch auto-deploys
- Merge to main when ready for production

### 3. Deploy Previews
- Pull requests get preview deployments
- Test before merging
- Comment with preview URL

### 4. Production Branch
- Set `main` as production branch
- Only this branch updates production
- Other branches = previews only

---

## Recommended Workflow

```
1. Deploy to Netlify (main branch) → Production URL
2. Continue development locally
3. Create feature branches → Auto preview deployments
4. Test previews
5. Merge to main when ready → Auto production deploy
```

---

## What You Get

### Free Tier Includes:
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 300 build minutes/month
- Unlimited sites
- Preview deployments
- HTTPS (automatic)
- Custom domain support

---

## Update Production Later

When you're ready to push to production:

1. Merge your feature branch to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/your-feature
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Netlify auto-deploys to production
3. Done! Your changes are live

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check `netlify.toml` configuration

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Make sure they start with `VITE_` for client-side
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check build logs for errors

### Routing Issues
- `netlify.toml` has redirect rules (already configured)
- All routes redirect to `index.html` for SPA
